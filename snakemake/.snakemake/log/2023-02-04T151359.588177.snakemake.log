The flag 'directory' used in rule all is only valid for outputs, not inputs.
Building DAG of jobs...

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

MissingOutputException in rule run_configurated_pipeline in file /lustre/BIF/nobackup/passa006/snakemake/startersnake, line 34:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/lustre/BIF/nobackup/passa006/dataresults
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
